# Contentstack ReactJS A/B Testing

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.
 
A/B Testing is an experiment where two different variants (A and B) of a page are displayed to users. This experiment helps in determining which variation users prefer. It's essentially a systematic approach to understand what works and what doesn't. You can then perform the analysis on user behavior which can help marketing teams during product campaigns and promotions.
